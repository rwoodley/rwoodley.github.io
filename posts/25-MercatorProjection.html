                        <p>The much-maligned Mercator Projection is indeed unsuitable for maps (famously it
renders Greenland as large as Africa when in fact it is as large as Saudi
Arabia):</p>

                        <p><img src="25-MercatorProjection_files/mercator_projection_world_map.jpg" alt="Mercator Projection World Map" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"></p>

                        <p>What is rarely mentioned is that the Mercator projection is infinite. That is,
if you extended it further north and further south the magnification would become
more and more extreme. David Swart has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn767ayiwYM">TedX video</a> on it and has worked extensively with its mathematics. He has also created many
amazing and whimsical projections.</p>

                        <p>Drew Roos has written a program (<a href="https://mrgris.com/projects/merc-extreme/">here</a>) that demonstrates this. Here is an example:</p>

                        <p><img src="25-MercatorProjection_files/extreme_mercator_example.jpg" alt="Extreme Mercator Projection Example" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"></p>

                        <p>So the above projection is the same view as the first one except, a) it is
turned on its side, and b) it extends much further – getting asymptotically closer to
the north pole on the right and the south pole on the left with higher and
higher degrees of magnification.</p>

                        <p>Since his images come from Google there is a limit to how much magnification he
can do. But you can certainly zoom in as far as Google can (to the city block
say).</p>

                        <p>There is no reason the north and south poles have to be, um, at the poles. We
can choose any pair of antipodes to be poles. For instance here is what it looks
like if we put the Arc De Triomphe at the north pole.</p>

                        <p><img src="25-MercatorProjection_files/arc_de_triomphe_projection.jpg" alt="Arc de Triomphe as North Pole" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"></p>

                        <p>Note the radiating spokes of the streets emanating from Place de L'Etoile.</p>

                        <p>Apparently Angor Wat is exactly antipodal to a town in Chincha Province, Peru:</p>

                        <p>And Wellington, NZ is antipodal to Alaejos Spain:</p>

                        <p><img src="25-MercatorProjection_files/wellington_antipodal.jpg" alt="Wellington NZ Antipodal Projection" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"></p>

                        <p>And Hong Kong is antipodal to La Quiaca Argentina:</p>

                        <p><img src="25-MercatorProjection_files/hong_kong_antipodal.jpg" alt="Hong Kong Antipodal Projection" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"></p>

                        <p>Anyhow play with it yourself here: <a href="https://mrgris.com/projects/merc-extreme/">https://mrgris.com/projects/merc-extreme/</a></p>

                        <p>The site <a href="https://www.antipodesmap.com/">antipodesmap.com</a> was useful for finding interesting antipodal pairs.</p>

                        <p>And do check out that video by David Swart for all the details.</p>

                        <p>The map at the top is from the Wikipedia article on the Mercator Projection.</p>
