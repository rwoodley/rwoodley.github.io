<p>Many have discovered Brent Yorgey’s <a href="http://mathlesstraveled.com/2012/10/05/factorization-diagrams/">very
		cool factorization diagrams</a>. They seem like a great way to teach multiplication and factorization to
	children.</p>
<p>We also were excited by the domino game suggested by Malke Rosenfeld <a
		href="http://mathinyourfeet.blogspot.com/2012/11/new-math-game-factor-dominoes.html">on her blog</a> and decided
	to try to take her ideas and see if we could create viable game that also would be a fun way to think about factors
	and primes. To this end we brought together a math geek, a visual artist and a 6 year old ninja and started playing.
	Through trial and error we arrived at a set of rules.</p>
<h3>Simple version of the rules:</h3>
<p>Start by printing out a deck of cards. (We have attached a pdf to this post with numbers up to 24 that can be printed
	on card stock and cut up.)</p>
<p>Each player gets 6 cards. One card is turned face up in the middle. The first player tries to match the turned up
	card, following the match rules below. After that, players can choose to match the card at either end of the growing
	chain. If you can’t match then you draw another card. First person to run out of cards wins.</p>
<p>The whole game comes down to the matching rules:<br>
	– The number 1 matches anything<br>
	– The number 2 matches any even number<br>
	– Primes match primes (or as you can explain to a child: circles match circles)<br>
	– Other numbers have a major and minor group. For instance 9 has a major group of 3 and a minor group of 3. 15 has a
	major group of 5 and a minor group of 3. 18 has a major group of 3 and a minor group of 6.</p>

</p>
<p>You can match based on major or minor group. If the card you want to play has the same major group or same minor
	group as the card to be matched, then you can play it. So 10 can match 15 (major group of 5 matches), and 9 can
	match 15 (minor group of 3 matches). A prime number can match either the minor or the major group, thus 5 can match
	10 (major group), but 3 can match 15 (minor group).</p>
<h3>Beyond the simple rules:</h3>
<p>We started to think about a rule set that might work if you had numbers higher than 24.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Types of number visualizations:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Primes are represented as circles.</p>
<p>Here are the types of Minor Groups:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Simple Minor groups are low primes:<br>
	1, 2, 3, 5, 7<br>
	<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-441" alt="low primes" src="./03-FactorDominoes_files/low-primes.jpg"
		width="983" height="180"
		sizes="(max-width: 983px) 100vw, 983px"></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Compounded minor groups:<br>
	4 (2×2), 6 (3×2)<br>
	<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-440" alt="compound" src="./03-FactorDominoes_files/compound.jpg"
		width="361" height="181"
		sizes="(max-width: 361px) 100vw, 361px"></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Doubly compounded minor groups:<br>
	8 (2x2x2), 9 (3x3x3), 16 (4x4x4), 18 (2x3x3)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Triple compounded minor groups:<br>
	24 (2x2x2x3), etc.</p>
<p>Major groups</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A major group is a combination of N copies of one of these minor or compounded groups.
</p>
<p>So here are the generalized matching rules:<br>
	– 1 matches anything<br>
	– 2 matches any even number<br>
	– Minor group types can be matched with each other within types, but not across.<br>
	– Major groups can be matched if they have an equal number of elements. For that, minor group types do not have to
	match.</p>
