                        <p>This is my first of 3 articles on the book <em>L&#8217;Anti-Oedipe </em>by Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari<em>.</em></p>
<p>A starting point for understanding <em>Anti-Oedipus</em> are the 2 concepts of Desiring-Production and Desiring-Machines. The concept of &#8216;fluxes&#8217; or flows is close to desiring-production and from there one discusses how flows are &#8216;coded&#8217; and &#8216;decoded&#8217;. Deleuze and Guattari see history from the point of view of how societies code and decode these flows, with capitalism being a superb machine for decoding flows. D&amp;G view the psychic and the social as interpenetrating, thus they have a lengthy discussion of the relationship between schizophrenia and capitalism (hence the subtitle of this book).</p>
<p>So the ideas that must be clearly understood to get a foot-hold on this book are: desiring-production, desiring-machines, fluxes, coding, decoding, deterritorialization.</p>
<p><strong>Desiring-Production</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The key term of Anti-Oedipus is “desiring-production,” which crisscrosses Marx and Freud, putting desire in the eco-social realm of production and production in the unconscious realm of desire.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Deleuze and Guattari will call desiring-production a “universal primary process” underlying the seemingly separate natural, social and psychological realms.<strong> Desiring-production is thus not anthropocentric; it is the very heart of the world</strong>. Besides its universal scope, we need to realize two things about desiring-production right away: (1) <strong>there is no subject that lies behind the production</strong>, that performs the production; and (2) the “desire” in desiring-production is not oriented to making up a lack, but is purely positive. Desiring-production is autonomous, self- constituting, and creative: it is the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">natura naturan</span>s of Spinoza or the will-to-power of Nietzsche.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">[1]</p>
<p>The highlights are mine. They are key points. In fact a &#8216;subject&#8217; only occurs in the 3rd synthesis, the Machine Miraculante, the production of consumption/consumation. See my subsequent post which mentions this in somewhat greater detail.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;Desire does not lack anything; it does not lack its object. It is, rather, the subject that is missing in desire, or desire that lacks a fixed subject; there is no fixed subject unless there is repression. Desire and its object are one and the same thing: the machine, as a machine of a machine. Desire is a machine, and the object of desire is another machine connected to it&#8221;.[8]</p>
<p>Deleuze: &#8220;The great discovery of psychoanalysis was that of the production of desire, of the productions of the unconscious.&#8221; [7]</p>
<p>&#8220;the unconscious does not mean anything&#8230;. the unconscious constructs machines, which are machines of desire&#8230; The unconscious does not speak, it engineers. It is not expressive or representative, but productive. A symbol is nothing other than a social machine that functions as a desiring-machine, a desiring-machine that functions within the social machine, an investment of the social machine by desire.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Desiring-Production/Desiring-Machines</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Deleuze and Guattari oppose the Freudian conception of the unconscious as a representational &#8220;theater&#8221;, instead favoring a productive &#8220;factory&#8221; model: desire is not an imaginary force based on lack, but a real, productive force. They describe the machinic nature of desire as a kind of &#8220;desiring-machine&#8221; that functions as a circuit breaker in a larger &#8220;circuit&#8221; of various other machines to which it is connected. Meanwhile, the desiring-machine is also producing a flow of desire from itself. Deleuze and Guattari conceptualize a multi-functional universe composed of such machines all connected to each other: &#8220;There are no desiring-machines that exist outside the social machines that they form on a large scale; and no social machines without the desiring machines that inhabit them on a small scale[1].&#8221; Desiring-production is explosive: &#8220;there is no desiring-machine capable of being assembled without demolishing entire social sectors&#8221;.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The concept of desiring-production is part of Deleuze and Guattari&#8217;s more general appropriation of Friedrich Nietzsche&#8217;s formulation of the Will to Power. In both concepts, a pleasurable force of appropriation of what is outside oneself, incorporating into oneself what is other than oneself, characterizes the essential process of all life. Similarly, a kind of reverse force of &#8220;forgetting&#8221; in Nietzsche and the body without organs in Deleuze and Guattari disavows the Will to Power and desiring-production, attempting to realize the ideal of an hermetic subject.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">[2]</p>
<p>Deleuze: &#8220;Desiring-machines are &#8230; the microphysics of the unconscious, the elements of the microunconscious. &#8220;[9]</p>
<p><strong>Coding and Decoding the Flux</strong></p>
<p>So we have the Desiring Production and Desiring Machines interrupting flows and producing flows.</p>
<p>There is a great article in the revue <a href="https://www.cairn.info/revue-cites-2010-1-page-99.htm">Cités</a>, by Charles Ramond that lays out very clearly the core concepts of &#8216;coding&#8217;, &#8216;decoding&#8217; and so forth. You should read the article (in french), but here is my very loose translation of some excerpts:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>For Deleuze and Guattari, reality is made of fluxes, (or flows) in the most vague sense of that term: forces, élans, moving objects, and above-all: &#8216;desires&#8217;. So the fluxes are are a form of universal energy (that we could also call &#8216;production&#8217;). One can find equivalents to this notion in some of Deleuze&#8217;s favorite authors: Bergson, Spinoza (&#8220;the effort to preserve the being&#8221;), and Nietzche&#8217;s Dionysus. These fluxes don&#8217;t exist on their own, they are always presented as framed, or informed, or structured, or to use Deleuze&#8217;s term: &#8216;coded&#8217;&#8230;. In the same manner as Lacan and Freud refer to the &#8216;real&#8217; which doesn&#8217;t appear directly but only if &#8216;coded&#8217; by the imagination, or in a dream&#8230;.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>So this idea is rather simple and natural. There is an interpenetrating duality between the &#8216;flux&#8217; on one hand: fluid, free, creative &#8211; but which which, left to itself, represents the risk of shapelessness and chaos. And on the other hand: the rigid, the framework, the structure, the law, the &#8220;code&#8221; (which often means something like a &#8220;law&#8221;, for example in &#8220;Civil Code&#8221;), which comes to frame and hinder to a certain extent this &#8220;power&#8221; (another Spinozist name for the Deleuzian &#8220;fluxes&#8221;), which is both a life force and a force for the destruction of &#8220;codes&#8221;.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>A society, like an individual, can live and survive only in the &#8220;coding&#8221; of &#8220;flows&#8221;. &#8230; It seems to the authors that humanity has progressed, albeit in a non-linear way, towards the current capitalist situation, that is to say towards a complete, destructive decoding of fluxes. There is a fairly widespread and fairly intuitive perception of capitalism in its essence as a regime or a type of economic, political and social functioning in which the old, traditional &#8220;codes&#8221; collapse. What we sometimes call &#8220;globalization&#8221;, the [modern, technological world] that promises us a quasi-ubiquity, allows us to detach ourselves more and more from the &#8220;earth&#8221;, to fly to heaven as gods, or to become &#8220;deterritorialized&#8221;, to use Deleuze&#8217;s term. </em><em>Capitalism and globalization indeed appear as a sort of generalized &#8220;decoding&#8221; of &#8220;flows&#8221; (nothing must be opposed to the circulation of flows and to their free propagation): frontiers, customs, laws or local customs become, in a capitalistic world, archaisms destined to be suppressed or folklorized.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Now, the &#8220;schizo&#8221;, breaking the old codes, the old laws, the old conventions, &#8220;decodes the fluxes&#8221;. In a coded system, he will usually be held for &#8220;crazy&#8221;. On the contrary, Deleuze and Guattari prefer to see a &#8220;prophet&#8221;, that is to say a &#8220;creator&#8221;, capable of bringing out the future in the present, like Artaud, Beckett, Van Gogh, Chaplin, Proust, Hölderlin, Turner, or Balzac.</em></p>
<p>Which brings us finally to the &#8220;Body without Organs&#8221; (Le Corps Sans Oganes). I will discuss this in my next post.</p>
<p>But his quote from Deleuze directly, illustrates the relationship between the Body without Organs and the deterritorialized socius.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;The body without organs is the deterritorialized socius, the wilderness where the decoded flows run free, the end of the world, the apocalypse. &#8230;[This is] what all societies dread absolutely as their most profound negative: namely, the decoded flows of desire.&#8221;[4]</p>
