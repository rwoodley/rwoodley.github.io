                        <p>I'm reading "L'Anti-Oedipe" (A-O) by Deleuze and Guattari. These are some notes
for myself. They may be total rubbish; I'm just trying to organize my thoughts.
This is my second of 3 articles on the book.</p>

                        <p>So the <strong>Body Without Organs</strong> (Corps Sans Organes) or <strong>BwO</strong>, is everywhere in A-O, and in the subsequent book, a Thousand Plateaus.
It really seems to be a cluster of concepts and it seems like D&G's notion of
it might have evolved over time.</p>

                        <p>The idea of the BwO struck me ever since I first heard of it in Deleuze's "To
Have Done with Judgement".<sup>[1]</sup> The title of the essay comes from Antonin Artaud's
banned play "To Have Done With the Judgement of God", wherein Artaud first uses
the term "Body Without Organs":</p>

                        <blockquote>
                            <p>"When you will have made him a body without organs,<br>
then you will have delivered him from all his automatic reactions<br>
and restored him to his true freedom."<sup>[9]</sup></p>
                        </blockquote>

                        <p>Artaud struggled with drugs and mental illness, and much of the BwO concept in
A-O in A Thousand Plateaus seems to involve sexual and pharmacological experimentation as a way to change
the programmed responses that the organs impose on our bodies. One thinks of
Rimbaud's "dérèglement des sens" in this regard as well. And there is discussion of how society uses language
and word order to program our responses which goes back to Levi-Strauss and
others. A Thousand Plateaus even dwells extensively on Carlos Castenada, at which point it is all becoming
rather embarrassing and one wonders if there is anything worth salvaging in the
BwO. (William Burroughs is also cited).</p>

                        <p>But there is more here than the old hippie dream that hedonism can be
spiritually liberating. Bordieu and Foucault and others discussed how societies and
families and schools control the body to control the individual. <strong>They control the
body through the organs. Without organs there is no control.</strong> Definitely in Artaud
but also with D&G there is this notion of restructuring the organs to liberate
experience. (D&G's discussion of sexual multiplicities can be understood in this
context: restructuring the organs).</p>

                        <p>But this is still an understanding that is focused on the individual. There is a
physical body that has to be reconfigured to free the … self? What is being
freed exactly? Remember that for D&G, <strong>desiring machines are primordial. The
unconscious is made of desiring machines.</strong> So if we consider the unconscious to exist in
the brain which in turn exists in the body, we have a completely different
world view from D&G, an inverted view. Instead: <strong>"The body is the object of
reproduction… it is not the subject. The only subject of reproduction is the unconscious…
Sexuality does not exist in the service of generation, rather the generation of
the body is in the service of sexuality which is used by the unconscious to
produce itself."</strong> <sup>[2][3]</sup> So they are not focused on the self, but on the
unconscious. What is being freed (or decoded) is flows of desire in the unconscious.</p>

                        <p>But we are still nonetheless in the realm of psychology, the individual. But D&G
generalize this: <strong>Organs are desiring machines. Reconfiguring organs corresponds
to decoding the flows of desire.</strong> This generalization allows us to speak of a
BwO for the socius (society, roughly). Thus these concepts are generalized from the individual to
society and this is useful in their synthesis of the psychic and the social, of
Freud and Marx.</p>

                        <p>The organs are the 'coded flows of desire' that the socius writes (enregistre) on the BwO (I think). <strong>Decoding the flows is the job of capitalism and/or
schizophrenia.</strong> When capitalism decodes the flows it extracts a plus-value (profit), and the deterritorialzed (decoded) flows make up the full body of the
socius. The schizophrenic takes a nomadic approach and heads straight for the
naked BwO.</p>

                        <p>What is this talk of 'full' and 'naked' BwO? The BwO is immanent in Spinoza's
sense: the idea of one immanent substance that all reality is made of. D&G speak
of the "naked BwO" as a limit, something that can be approached asymptotically
but never attained. They distinguish the naked BwO from the full BwO, or
fully-clothed BwO. <strong>"The socius – the earth, the body of the despot, capital/money – are
the fully-clothed bodies. They are like a BwO, a fully naked body: but this naked
body is a limit, at the end, not at the origin. The [naked] BwO haunts these
other forms of the socius."</strong><sup>[4]</sup></p>

                        <p>Thus there are 2 kinds of BwO, a 'full body' and a 'naked' body. Sometimes BwO
refers to the full body and other times to the naked body.</p>

                        <h3>The Full BwO:</h3>

                        <p>The full body is a paranoiac machine that repulses organs.<sup>[5]</sup> The full body is a
social creation, the socius. Capital in capitalism is an example of a full
BwO.</p>

                        <blockquote>
                            <p>"Capital is indeed the body without organs of the capitalist, or rather of the
capitalist being. But as such, it is not only the fluid and petrified substance
of money, for it will give to the sterility of money the form whereby money
produces money. It produces surplus value, just as the body without organs reproduces
itself, puts forth shoots, and branches out to the farthest corners of the
universe. It makes the machine responsible for producing a relative surplus value,
while embodying itself in the machine as fixed capital. Machines and agents cling
so closely to capital that their very functioning appears to be miraculated by
it. Everything seems objectively to be produced by capital as quasi cause." <sup>[6]</sup></p>
                        </blockquote>

                        <h3>The Naked BwO:</h3>

                        <blockquote>
                            <p>"The body without organs, the unproductive, the unconsumable, serves as a surface
for the recording of the entire process of production of desire, so that
desiring-machines seem to emanate from it in the apparent objective movement that
establishes a relationship between the machines and the body without organs…
Doubtless the former paranoiac machine continues to exist in the form of mocking voices
that attempt to "de-miraculate" (demiracu-ler) the organs… But the essential
thing is the establishment of an enchanted recording or inscribing surface that
arrogates to itself all the productive forces and all the organs of production,
and that acts as a quasi cause by communicating the apparent movement (the
fetish) to them. So true is it that the schizo practices political economy, and that
all sexuality is a matter of economy." <sup>[7]</sup></p>
                        </blockquote>

                        <p>And finally…</p>

                        <blockquote>
                            <p>"The body without organs is not the proof of an original nothingness, nor is it
what remains of a lost totality. Above all, it is not a projection; it has
nothing whatsoever to do with the body itself, or with an image of the body. It is
the body without an image. This imageless, organless body, the nonproductive,
exists right there where it is produced, in the third stage of the binary-linear
series." <sup>[8]</sup></p>
                        </blockquote>

                        <p>There are hundreds of other pages on the BwO in Anti-Oedipus alone, and there is
much more to it.</p>

                        <hr>

                        <p><sup>[1]</sup> This is a magnificent philosophical essay that is really a piece or art or
prose poetry. When we read it, we understand how to read Deleuze: which is as a
great philosophical prose poet. He even tells us how to read him: "For reading a
text is never a scholarly exercise in search of what is signified, still less a
highly textual exercise in search of a signifier. Rather it is a productive
use of the literary machine, a montage of desiring-machines, a schizoid exercise
that extracts from the text its revolutionary force." (A-O, page 106.)</p>

                        <p><sup>[2]</sup> L'A-O, page 131. My v loose translation.</p>

                        <p><sup>[3]</sup> In L'A-O, page 396, the authors discuss how the unconscious reproduces.
"The signifying chain of the unconscious, Numen, is not used to decipher or
discover codes of desire, but rather to transmit entirely decoded flows of desire,
Libido, and to find in that desire that which scrambles all the codes and undoes all
the territories." and "This chain is how the gene of the unconscious, which is
always a subject, reproduces itself." A very beautiful dynamic described there.</p>

                        <p><sup>[4]</sup> L'A-O, page 338.</p>
