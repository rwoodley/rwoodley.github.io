<p>A triangle is the simplest regular figure in 2 dimensions. Its 3 dimensional analogue is a tetrahedron. Its 4 dimensional analogue is the pentatope. Another term for these 3 geometries is: simplex. Many articles online explain these further.</p>
<p>I wanted to view what it would look like if a pentatope passed through our 3-dimensional space. There are many examples of what the projection of a pentatope onto 3-d space would look like (ie its shadow), but I didn&#8217;t want to do that because while projections can be pretty, they seem less intuitive than cross-sections. </p>
<p>To summarize, the plan was: take 3-dimensional cross-sections of the pentatope (a 4 dimensional shape). The actual drawing will be done using the 3-dimensional drawing toolkit called three.js.</p>
<p>Our equation for the 3-dimensional cross-section is:</p>
<pre>
    ax+by+cz+K = w

</pre>
<p>This is a linear equation; we&#8217;re not dealing with curved cross-sections for now, though that would be fun. a,b, and c are constants. x,y,z, and w are the 4 axes. K is a constant that we change to get different cross-sections.</p>
<p>But why do we need 4 dimensions to describe a 3-dimensional space? Because we are locating that 3-d space in 4 dimensions. Just as the equation for a plane in 3-d space requires 3 dimensions (e.g. x+y = z describes a plane in 3-d space).</p>
<p>What about our equation for pentatope? Well we don&#8217;t have an equation, but we have a collection of points. Our pentatope has 5 corners. Lines connect each point to every other point, resulting in 10 lines. These 10 lines in turn form 10 faces (2-d planes). These 10 faces in turn from 5 3-d tetrahedrons.</p>
<p>Note that in general:<br />
&#8211; The intersection of a 4-d line and a 3-d space is a point.<br />
&#8211; The intersection of a 4-d plane and a 3-d space is a line.<br />
&#8211; The intersection of a 4-d volume and a 3-d space is a plane.<br/>
<i>(I say "in general" because there is the special case where the entity intersecting in fact lies 
entirely in the subspace. For example a 4-d line could lie entirely in a 3-d space. In that case the intersection is the line itself.)</i></p>

<p>Our cross-section is going to look like a wire-frame, in other words a collection of lines. So we will capture the intersection of the pentatope&#8217;s faces with our cross-sectional space.</p>
<p>Our pseudo-code would look like this:</p>
<pre>
foreach (face in faces) {   // 10 of these
  // Each face is a triangle. Lets name the vertices p0, p1, p2. These points have 4-d coords.
  // point1 and 2 will be the points we use to draw a line in 3-d space using three.js.
  // they have 3-d coords of course.
  point1 = calculateIntersectionOfLineWithSpace(p0,p1); 
  point2 = calculateIntersectionOfLineWithSpace(p0,p2);
  drawLineUsingThreeJS(point1, point2);
}

</pre>
<p>So the interesting bit is in &#8216;calculateIntersectionOfLineWithSpace()&#8217;:</p>
<p>We must use parametric equations to work with lines in dimensions higher than 2. The parametric form for a line defined by the points p0 and p1 is: </p>
<pre>
    p = p0 + t*v   (1)

    where v = p1 - p0.

</pre>
<p>We need to calculate what the value of t is at the intersection with our cross-sectional space. (p0 and p1 are the vertices of one of the faces of our pentatope.) So we need to solve for t. </p>
<pre>
    t = (Pt - P0)/V

</pre>
<p>Pt is the point of intersection of the line with the cross-sectional space. Given our formula above for our 3-d cross-sectional space, the equation for t is:</p>
<pre>
    t = (W0-aX0-bY0-cZ0-K)/(aXv+bYv+cZv-Wv)

    Where P0 = (X0, Y0, Z0, W0) and V is (Xv, Yv, Zv, Wv). 

</pre>
<p>Plugging t into equation (1) above we calculate the point of intersection of our 4-d line with our 3-d space. We return (x,y,z) from &#8216;calculateIntersectionOfLineWithSpace()&#8217; above, discarding w.</p>
<p>And we simply change K to see different cross-sections. The animated result is
