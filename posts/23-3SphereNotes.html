                        <h3>Rotations</h3>

                        <p>A rotation in 2 dimensions leaves one single point stationary. A rotation in 3
dimensions leaves an axis stationary. A rotation in 4 dimensions leaves a plane
stationary. So in 4d everything rotates around a plane. Now we can additionally
choose to rotate that stationary plane, thereby doing 2 planar rotations at once.
I believe this is what is referred to as an isoclinic or Clifford rotation,
whereby you have a pair of rotating orthogonal 2 planes that intersect only at one
point. [3]</p>

                        <h3>Hopf Circles, Hopf Fibrations, Hopf Links</h3>

                        <p>The intersection of a complex line in C² containing the origin, with S³ is a
circle. This is true for every line passing through the origin whose equation is
of the form z₂=a*z₁ where a is a complex number and z₂ and z₁ are the coordinates of C². By 'line' we mean one-dimensional subspace which we
can think of as a plane. Thus there is a circle in S³ for each complex number a (including the case where a is infinite). The sphere S³ is therefore filled with circles, one for each
point of S², that is, for each complex number a. (The as fill all of C¹ which we can identify with the Riemann Sphere). As Thurston
says "exactly one Hopf circle passes through each point of S³" and "the
three-sphere is a two-sphere's worth of circles".[4]</p>

                        <p>(Note: A complex line in C² is a one dimensional subspace thereof. We can
visualize a complex line in C² by imagining a plane in R⁴, but not all planes in R⁴
are one dimensional subspaces of C². [1])</p>

                        <p>The Hopf fibration is this map from the unit 3-sphere to the unit 2-sphere.
(This is different than stereographic project to R³!).</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>The inverse image of each point on the 2-sphere is a circle. Thus, these images
decompose the 3-sphere into a continuous family of circles, and each two
distinct circles form a Hopf link. The linking is what makes the fibration a
non-trivial fibration.[9]</li>
                            <li>The inverse image of a circle of latitude on S² under the fiber map is a torus, and these project to nested toruses in R³ which
fill space. The individual fibers link to Villarceau circles on these tori with
the exception of the circle through the projection point and the one through
its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipodal_point">opposite point</a>: the former maps to a straight line, the latter to a unit circle perpendicular
to, and centered on, this line, which may be viewed as a degenerate torus whose
radius has shrunken to zero. Every other fiber image encircles the line as well,
and so, by symmetry, each circle is linked through every circle, both in R³ and in S³. Two such linking circles form a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopf_link">Hopf link</a> in R³ [10]</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>The n-dimensional complex project space CPⁿ is the set of all complex lines on
Cⁿ⁺¹ passing through the origin. [2] Thus C² projects to CP¹, the Riemann sphere. Homogenous coordinates
represent the same point in the projective space. As we saw above a=z₂/z₁, and each value of a specifies a different set of homogeneous coordinates, therefore a line through
the origin of C² maps to a point in CP¹. CP¹ is the set of all complex
one-dimensional subspaces of C². A fancier way to say it, as Wikipedia does is: "CP¹ is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotient_space_(topology)">quotient</a> of C²\{0} by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation">equivalence relation</a> which identifies (z₀, z₁) with (λ z₀, λ z₁) for any nonzero complex number λ. On any complex line in C² there is a circle of unit norm, and so the restriction of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotient_map">quotient map</a> to the points of unit norm is a fibration of S³ over CP¹."</p>

                        <h3>Stereographic Projection from S³ to R³</h3>

                        <p>So the Hopf fibration can be thought of as a map from S³ to CP¹, or to S². But that is not really a visualization tool at all, it is just a
map. To visualize entities embedded in S³ we can stereographically project to R³.
I'm not going to summarize how to do that, because it is in a million places on
the web, e.g. [7].</p>

                        <p>Under stereographic projection of S³ to R³,</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Radial planes in R³ correspond to 2-spheres through N (the north pole, i.e.
infinity in R³) in S³.</li>
                            <li>The equator of S³ projects to a sphere, S², of radius 1 centered at the origin
of R³.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>I initially confused Hopf Circles with Great circles and C² with R⁴. Not every 
two dimensional plane in R⁴ is a one dimensional subspace of C². Any plane in
R⁴ that goes through the origin intersects S³ in a great circle. But Hopf circles
are the intersections of complex lines with S³. Note that unlike for S², two
great circles need not intersect in S³.</p>

                        <h3>Entities embedded in S³</h3>

                        <h4>1. Clifford Torus.</h4>

                        <p>This is a flat torus that lives in R⁴ and is embedded in S³. "Flat" means it has
zero Gaussian curvature everywhere. By "embedded in S³", we mean that all
points on the surface are unit distance from the origin. So both of these statements
are mind-bending but also strangely intuitive. If you use the standard formula
for a Clifford Torus and perform stereographic projection:</p>

                        <pre><code>// Clifford Torus Parameterization
var f=1/Math.sqrt(2);
var xx=f*Math.cos(u);
var yy=f*Math.sin(u);
var zz=f*Math.cos(v);
var rr=f*Math.sin(v);
// Stereographic projection:
var x=xx/(1-rr);
var y=yy/(1-rr);
var z=zz/(1-rr);</code></pre>

                        <p>you get… a donut:</p>

                        <p><img src="23-3SphereNotes_files/Screen-Shot-2017-11-17-at-11.57.54-PM-768x620.png" alt="Clifford Torus as donut"></p>

                        <p>However, if you rotate the projection point:</p>

                        <pre><code>var xx = Math.cos(u+theta) *Math.cos(v+phi);
var yy = Math.cos(u+theta) *Math.sin(v+phi);
var zz = Math.sin(u+theta) *Math.cos(v+phi);
var rr = Math.sin(u+theta) *Math.sin(v+phi);</code></pre>

                        <p>you get something that looks like a plane with handles:</p>

                        <p><img src="23-3SphereNotes_files/Screen-Shot-2017-11-18-at-12.04.46-AM-768x496.png" alt="Clifford Torus as plane with handles"></p>

                        <p>I got these formulas from "Sculptures in S³" by Saul Schleimer and Henry
Segerman, which is a very interesting paper with many practical (as in fun)
applications.</p>

                        <p>This plane with handles has more structure than it seem, so I left some gaps in
the surface which brings out the structure more:</p>

                        <p><img src="23-3SphereNotes_files/clifford_torus_gaps.png" alt="Clifford Torus with gaps showing structure"></p>

                        <p>A Clifford torus divides the 3-sphere into 2 solid tori. This was hard for me to
grasp initially. But if you consider the surface of the donut above (the Clifford torus is a surface), it in-fact divides R³
into 2 solid tori. It is clear that the inside of the donut is a solid torus, but
the outside is also a solid torus in the pre-image of the projection, i.e. in
S³. Perhaps a little sloppy, but that's the intuition.</p>

                        <p>There are other fun parameterizations in the Segerman/Schleimer paper. Here are
a few I coded up:</p>
