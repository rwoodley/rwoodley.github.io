<p>Building a face recognition algorithm involves a whole string of design decisions, each of which will impact how well
	the system can identify faces.</p>
<p>Here is a partial list of these decisions (*):</p>
<p>– Choice of faces used to train the detection algo. Note that both a positive and negative set is needed. In other
	words you need to show it faces it should recognize, and faces (or other images) it should reject.<br>
	– Image preprocessing decisions (size, greyscale, normalization).<br>
	– Face alignment corrections.<br>
	– Number of eigen vectors to use. In other words, the number of dimensions of your face space.<br>
	– Number of low order eigen vectors to exclude. The idea being that low order vectors encode irrelevant (for face
	recognition) information like lighting.<br>
	– Similarity measures. Aka nearest neighbor measures. (Euclidean vs Mahalanobis etc)<br>
	– Choice of PCA methodology (Eigenfaces vs Fisherfaces).</p>
<p>After laboriously doing numerous comparisons across multiple training sets on my own, I discovered this paper
	published in 2001 where some researchers investigated these issues in a very systematic fashion.<br>
	Computational and Performance Aspects of PCA-based Face Recognition Algorithms, by H. Moon and P. J. Phillips,
	Perception, 2001, Vol 30, pg 303-321 and (NISTIR 6486)<br>

</p>
<p>I was reassured to see that their conclusions were close to my own (which I’ll write up later). It is worth reading
	the entire paper, but some of main conclusions I took away are:</p>
<p>– Image Normalization helps, but the particular implementation is not critical.<br>
	– Performance increases until approximately 200 eigenvectors, then decreases slightly. However much of the
	performance gain can be captured with 100 eigenvectors.<br>
	– Removing the first low-order eigen vectors is best, removing the 2nd helps slightly.<br>
	– The similarity measure has a huge effect. Using an enhanced Mahalanobis classifier gives the best result.</p>
<p>(*) note that I’m following the framework implemented in the OpenCV software, namely using Haar classifiers for
	detection and some form of PCA for recognition.</p>
